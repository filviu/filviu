## âœ¨ Hi, I'm Silviu

Iâ€™m a DevOps engineer / sysadmin, tech and open source enthusiast by day and amateur photographer and traveler in my spare time. I also 3d print and build/repair/break stuff regularly in my garage.

- ðŸ”­ I worked as a DevOPS engineer, sysadmin, software engineer and currently I'm lead devops at [smartkyc](https://wwww.smartkyc.com).
- ðŸŒ± I'm maintaining several ansible roles and docker images.
- ðŸ‘¯ If you run an opensource project and need systems/ops/devops support I might be able to help.
- ðŸ“« You can get in touch via [mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@filviu), [github](https://github.com/filviu/filviu/issues) or better yet check my [.me page](https://filviu.me).
