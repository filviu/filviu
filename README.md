## âœ¨ Hi, I'm Silviu

Iâ€™m a DevOps engineer / sysadmin, tech and open source enthusiast by day and amateur photographer and traveler in my spare time. I also 3d print and build/repair/break stuff regularly in my garage.

- ğŸ”­ I worked as a DevOPS engineer, sysadmin, software engineer and currently I'm lead devops at [smartkyc](https://wwww.smartkyc.com).
- ğŸŒ± I'm maintaining several ansible roles and docker images.
- ğŸ‘¯ If you run an opensource project and need systems/ops/devops support I might be able to help.
- ğŸ“« You can get in touch via [twitter](https://twitter.com/filviu), [github](https://github.com/filviu/filviu/issues) or linkedin.
